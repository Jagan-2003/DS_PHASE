                                                                     Air Quality Analysis Project

Introduction:
This project aims to analyze air quality data in Tamil Nadu, providing insights into pollutant levels and trends. The analysis includes the calculation of average concentrations of SO2, NO2, and RSPM/PM10 across different monitoring stations, cities, or areas. Various visualization techniques are employed using Matplotlib and Seaborn to represent trends over time and spatial variations.

Project Structure:
- Air_Quality_Analysis.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis code. This notebook can be executed directly.
- data/: Directory containing the dataset.
- requirements.txt: File listing the required Python libraries.

Instructions for Replicating the Analysis:

Step 1: Clone the Repository
Clone the GitHub repository containing the project's code and dataset. You can use the following command:
command prompt:
      git clone <repository_url>

Step 2: Navigate to the Project Directory
Change your current working directory to the project directory. If you cloned the repository into a specific folder, navigate to that folder using the `cd` command:
command prompt:
       cd <project_directory>

Step 3: Install Dependencies
Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. Navigate to the project directory and install the required libraries by running:
command prompt:
      pip install -r requirements.txt

Step 4: Run the Jupyter Notebook
Open the Jupyter Notebook named `Air_Quality_Analysis.ipynb`:
command prompt:
      jupyter notebook Air_Quality_Analysis.ipynb

Step 5: Execute the Code
Run each cell in the notebook sequentially to load the data, perform calculations, and generate visualizations.

Step 6: User Input and Prediction
When prompted, enter SO2 and NO2 concentrations to predict the corresponding RSPM/PM10 level.

Step 7: Analyze Visualizations
Examine the visualizations generated, including trends over time, box plots, daily average air quality, and the heatmap.

 Summary of Key Findings:

1. Average Pollution Levels:
   - Calculated average concentrations of SO2, NO2, and RSPM/PM10 across different monitoring stations and areas.

2. Trend Analysis:
   - Identified trends in air pollution over time, focusing on SO2, NO2, and RSPM/PM10 levels.

3. Daily Average Air Quality:
   - Visualized day-to-day variations in SO2, NO2, and RSPM/PM10 concentrations.

4. Predictive Modeling:
   - Trained a linear regression model to predict RSPM/PM10 levels based on SO2 and NO2 concentrations.

5. User Input and Prediction:
   - Allowed users to input SO2 and NO2 concentrations for predicting RSPM/PM10 levels.

6. Heatmap Visualization:
   - Presented a heatmap visualizing pollutant levels by location and time.

Conclusion :
In conclusion, this air quality analysis contributes to informed decision-making processes, aiding in the identification of high-pollution areas, understanding pollution trends, and guiding efforts to improve air quality in Tamil Nadu.
